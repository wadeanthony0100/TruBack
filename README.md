# Chrome sucks right now.

If you're on the latest version of Chrome, the backspace button doesn't go back. It's infuriating. This script fixes that a little. It's imperfect- it takes half a second to load, and I haven't tested it for more than a few seconds, but it worked well enough. It's nothing impressive but if you find a way to make it better, pull requests are welcome, and I will update the Chrome Store if any good improvements are made.
